# Goals of our Pre-Processing File

We will work here in this document to remove any unncessary ASVs or samples, such as: 

1. Mitochondria ASVs. 
2. Chloroplast ASVs.  
3. Deal with the controls:  
    a. ASVs found in the controls.  
    b. Control samples themselves.  
4. Mock ASVs/Mock Community.  
5. Samples that have too few reads for reasonable ecological analysis.


## Load Packages and Functions

```{r load-packages-functions}
# Load Packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, phyloseq, install = FALSE)

# Source functions
source("code/functions.R")
source("code/colors_and_shapes.R")
```

## Load the data!

```{r load-data}
# Load in the raw_phyloseq data from DADA2_workflow.Rmd
load("data/raw_physeq.RData")

# Take a look at the S4 object!
raw_physeq

# Tell us about you phyloseq!
str(raw_physeq)
typeof(raw_physeq)

#View(raw_physeq@otu_table)
#View(raw_physeq@tax_table)
#View(data.frame(sample_data(raw_physeq)))
```


# Remove unnecessary taxa

We will need to remove the ASVs that are mitochondria, chloroplast or within the mock community. 

```{r rm-ASVs}
# Make a new phyloseq object without the mitochondria, chloroplast or mock community
noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq <- 
  raw_physeq %>%
  # Remove the mitochondria ASVs.  #NOTE THERE WAS A TYPO HERE IN CLASS! 
  subset_taxa(Family != "Mitochondria" | is.na(Family)) %>%
  # Remove the chloroplast ASVs 
  subset_taxa( Order !="Chloroplast" | is.na(Order)) %>%
  # remove the mock community and its ASVs 
  prune_samples(sample_names(.) %!in% c("CJ-V08-P", "MockZymoPos"), .) %>%
  # Now we will remove any ASVs of count 0
  prune_taxa(taxa_sums(.) > 0, .)

# Let's take a look 
noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq

# How many taxa have we removed so far? 
num_ASVs_rm <- ntaxa(raw_physeq) - ntaxa(noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq)
num_ASVs_rm

# Proportion of original data maintained
prop_ASV_rm <- ntaxa(noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq)/ntaxa(raw_physeq)
prop_ASV_rm
```

Now, we could write our methods: 

Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and mock communities were removed resulting in the loss of `r (1-prop_ASV_rm)*100`% of the data.



## Remove Control samples 

Next, we will need to remove ASVs that are found within our controls. 

```{r rm-controls}
#3. Control samples.  
# Create a vector with the control samples 
control_samples <- c("WaterControl", "022um-Control", "3um-Control", "DNA-Ext-Control")

# Which taxa are in the control samples? 
control_physeq <- 
  noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq %>%
  # Identify control samples
  subset_samples(., (names %in% control_samples)) %>%
  # make sure to remove the ASVs that were not in the controls 
  prune_taxa(taxa_sums(.) > 0, .)

# Check out the phyloseq object 
control_physeq

# vector of control ASVs
control_ASVs <- 
  data.frame(control_physeq@tax_table)$ASV

# Plot the abundance of control ASVs across the 4 samples 
control_physeq %>%
  plot_bar(., "ASV", fill = "ASV")

################################# ASV ANALYSIS YOU CAN SKIP #################################
# Make a phyloseq object with only the control ASVs in it 
controlASVs_physeq <- 
  noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq %>%
  subset_taxa(., ASV %in% control_ASVs)

# Check it out
controlASVs_physeq

# Let's take a look at the plot 
controlASVs_physeq %>%
  plot_bar(., "ASV", fill="ASV", facet_grid=Sample_or_Control~.) + 
  labs(title = "All Control ASV Abundance in Samples vs Controls") +

        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

# From this plot, it looks like ASV_1 is REAL and perhaps ASV_20? Let's check 
controlASVs_physeq %>%
  subset_taxa(., ASV %in% c("ASV_3", "ASV_1", "ASV_20")) %>% #

  labs(title = "Should we keep these ASVs?") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5))

# All the other OTUs 
controlASVs_physeq %>%
  subset_taxa(., ASV %!in% c("ASV_3", "ASV_1", "ASV_20")) %>% # ALSO SHOW "ASV_20"
  plot_bar(., "ASV", fill="ASV", facet_grid=Sample_or_Control~.) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

# FROM ABOVE ANALYSIS 
# "ASV_1" and "ASV_20" MUST BE KEPT IN THE DATA! 
# Make a vector of all ASVs to remove
control_ASVs_toREMOVE <- dplyr::setdiff(control_ASVs, c("ASV_1", "ASV_20"))

# Now make a new phyloseq object without these! 
length(control_ASVs_toREMOVE)
length(control_ASVs)

## Actually remove the ASVs! 
# Create Phyloseq object that has control samples removed. 
noCONTROLSMitoChloroCJMock_physeq <- 
  noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq %>%
  # Now remove ASVs found in control samples samples, EXCEPT ASV_1 and ASV_20
  subset_taxa(., (ASV %!in% control_ASVs_toREMOVE)) %>%
  # Now remove control samples

  # Remove ASVs with 0 counts.

noCONTROLSMitoChloroCJMock_physeq

# After filtering we have removed a total of how many ASVs? 
total_ASVs_rm <- ntaxa(raw_physeq) - ntaxa(noCONTROLSMitoChloroCJMock_physeq)
total_ASVs_rm
```




**Removing ASVs!**  
- There were `r ntaxa(noMitoChloroCJMock_physeq)` ASVs that were chloroplasts or mitochondria, extra sample, or mock community.
- There were `r length(control_ASVs_toREMOVE)` in the control samples. 
- A total of `r total_ASVs_rm` were removed in our filtering steps.
- Now, we have a total of `r ntaxa(noCONTROLSMitoChloroCJMock_physeq)`
