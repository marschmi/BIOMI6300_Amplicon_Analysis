# Amplicon Sequencing Workflow

Here in this folder are 4 steps for the amplicon sequence workflow:


1. DADA2 workflow: How to assign ASVs and their taxonomy from raw fastq 
files.  
2. PreProcessing: Removing any ASVs and samples that may be unnecessary or 
contaminants.  
3. Diversity Analysis: Measuring alpha (within-sample) diversity measure 
of Richness, Shannon, and Simpson.  
4. Compositional Analysis: Scaling the reads, calculating bray-curtis 
dissimilarity, PCoA analysis, PERMANOVA, 
and beta dispr.
